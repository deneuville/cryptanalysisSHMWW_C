# cryptanalysisSHMWW_C
C implementation of the cryptanalysis of Song *et al.* code-based signature scheme, publishesd in [Theoretical Computer Science](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2020.05.011)

This repository hosts:
1. a C++ implementation of the code-based signature scheme proposed by Song, Huang, Mu, Wu, and Wang [Theoretical Computer Science](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2020.05.011),
1. a C++ cryptanalysis implementation that recovers the secret key from 10 signatures or more.

## Compiling the software

To run the software, you should have `gf2x` and `ntl` installed at a standard location `/usr/local` (modify the `Makefile` accordingly otherwise).

Simply run `make`.

## Generating an instance along with signatures

Song *et al.* proposed two sets of parameters: PARA-1 and PARA-2 respectively targeting 80 and 128 bits of classical security (see Table 1 of [SHMWW]).

To generate an instance of PARA-`X` along with `N` signatures for that instance, run:
```./breakSHMWW X N 1```

If you want to run `K` such instances (iteratively), replace `1` in the previous command by `K`:
```./breakSHMWW X N K```

To reduce the burden of manipulating files, the keys and signatures are voluntary not stored.

For cryptanalytic purposes, the use of a weight restricted hash (WRH) function is not mandatory. Instead, we generate the challenge as a vector c of same lenght (h') and weight (w_1) as the output of the WRH function described in [SHMWW].

By default, the software provides information about:
1. The time it took to generate the keypair (SHMWW-related)
1. The time it took to generate the signatures (SHMWW-related)
1. The time it took to verify those signatures (SHMWW-related)
1. Timings and sub-routine internal information (internal-related)
1. The time it took to cryptanalyse the instance.

If you are not interrested in internal-related information, modify line `5` of `cryptanalysisSHMWW.cpp` the following way:
```#define _TOTAL_INFO_ 0```

If you are not interrested in SHMWW-related information, modify line `6` of `cryptanalysisSHMWW.cpp` the following way:
```#define _SHMWW_INFO_ 0```

Depending on the instance, the number of signatures available and your machine, the scripts may take more than 30 minutes to complete (almost for PARA-2).

## Example of output for each parameter set

Some sample cryptanalysis results using 100 signatures for both parameter sets. (obtained with Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz)
